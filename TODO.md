# TODO

- [ ] Compress all images to reduce bundle size (https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image)
- [-] Re-color theme with colors from surf images
- [ ] Add lightweight animations
- [ ] Add 'openws' surf guide with message 'free' and 'recommended'
- [x] Move dark/light mode switch to settings to be more obvious, make it default to system settings
- [ ] !!! Take a look once more on the potential of browser local LLM? Because people may value total privacy over speed. Speed optimizations such as chunking may be needed 
- [x] Add a transition when switching from dark mode and light mode and vice-versa
- [ ] Re-order settings divs to be more logical to most used
- [x] Add a max displayed whitelist domains functionality to show maybe 10 domains max, and press that "more" button to show the rest
- [x] Organize displayed whitelist domains by domain name and sort them alphabetically (case-insensitive)
- [ ] Animate characters from surf images for better interactiveness
