SurfSafe uses advanced AI to analyze every website you visit in real-time, detecting potential scams, phishing attempts, and fraudulent content before you become a victim.

**🛡️ Key Features:**
• Real-time analysis of every page you visit
• Detects 9 different threat categories
• Clear risk ratings: SAFE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
• Detailed explanations for each assessment
